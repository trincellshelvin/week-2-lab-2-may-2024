  <h1>About...In a Nutshell</h1></body>
<main>
  <body>
    <p>I am a crafter. I love creating new things to either update the look of my home or to add to my home's look and feel for comfort.</p>
      <p>I am also a self taught chef and foodie. I love taking known Louisiana dishes and creating them again in a healthier manner.</p>
    <p>I am not just a crafter and foodie/chef. I am a fur mommy to a very spoiled  dogs named Buddy Boyo and Pepper (affectionately named by me as My Peppermint). A Lot of my time is spent with them working on obedience training and watching their favorite shows when I am not working on something or away from home.</p>
